# Terraform Provisioner Example

This Terraform project is designed to showcase the use of Provisioner blocks in Terraform.

In aws_instance.tf an EC2 instance is created using the aws_instance resource block and is configured with an Apache web server that displays a custom HTML page with the instance ID and public IP address.

Other necessary VPC configs are presented in aws_vpc.tf.
